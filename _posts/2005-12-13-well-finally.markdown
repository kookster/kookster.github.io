<p>well, finally.</p>
<p>I spent the last few days trying to revive an old pII/350mhz PC.<br />
Having exorcised redhat9, an ill-timed installation as this particular curse damned itself in favor of fedora days after I installed, I had to pick a sexy new distro to play with...so what else, but go with little-miss-popular, i.e. <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com">ubuntu</a>?</p>
<p>After downloading the ISO twice, burning four CDs at various speeds and orientations to the crab nebula and burning bushes, I got one that installed on my eighth attempt.  <a href="http://www.boreme.com/boreme/funny-2005/bruce-lee-screentest-p1.php">My kung-fu</a> is the best. So far so good, I am typing on it now, and looking for other fun to put it through its paces.  Actually pretty usable for all that it is ancient - gee, maybe you don't need to gigs of memory to be happy after all.</p>
<p>I also need some better way to get it networked, as I have no wifi card for it, and it is across the house from my hub.  Like everyone else I am sure, I have a  50' ethernet cable around I am using at present, but as I don't wish to make yet another electrical hazard in my home, this is not a permanent solution...<!--22cdc1201967c4f8c6bd07c80289cd47--></p>
