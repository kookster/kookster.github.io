<p>Way too long since I last posted, but more time is at hand. </p>
<p>Talked to my brother, he's hopefully dodging an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/31/ippr_irregular_migration/">ID</a> card since he is already in Scotland, and is legal and all.</p>
<p>What a lovely time. Tech makes nations and geography less important (arguably), while politicians highlight the importance of national origin as the difference between <a href="http://www.myleftwing.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=7073">criminal and patriot</a>.</p>
<p>Does it need to be said? Villainizing illegal immigrants is a PC way to hate minorities. You know, it's not that they are different and poor and not white, it's that they are criminals (they're illegal , so that means they're criminals, right?) and probably terrorists to boot (right out of the country).</p>
<p>Besides, they are all thieves because they are stealing our jobs. I wonder if the politicians noticed that these "criminals" can't vote before they made them into congressional punching bags?</p>
<p>So maybe, just maybe, this is all code - some subtle form of racism (on second thought, not all that subtle).</p>
