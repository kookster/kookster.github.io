<p><b>begins in wonder?</b></p>
<p>There are various translations of quotes/writings attributed to Socrates and Plato that go "Philosophy begins in wonder" or "Wisdom begins in wonder".  Translations aside, I like both ideas, and they stuck with me enough to make me pick this domain name. And yes, I am a big philosophy geek.<!--3751a3ae6712747ccda8e3c6f0008bb4--></p>
