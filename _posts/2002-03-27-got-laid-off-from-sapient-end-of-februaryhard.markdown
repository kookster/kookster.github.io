<p>Got laid off from sapient, end of february.</p>
<p>Hard to feel bad about it, since it is a large group of laid off alumni I join.</p>
<p>Already have a new and better paying job.</p>
<p>Again, hard to feel bad about it.</p>
<p>So how should I <a href="http://www.dell.com">spend</a> my severence?<!--f4276ca7609aa592ffaf2b94ade1a5d2--></p>
