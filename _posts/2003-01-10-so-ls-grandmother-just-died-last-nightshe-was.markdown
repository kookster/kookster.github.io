<p>So L's grandmother just died last night.</p>
<p>She was fairly old (90+), and had very poor eyesight, so for the first few times we met, her epithet for me was the guy in the striped shirt.</p>
<p>For me it is not so bad, I didn't know her long or well, but in fact I saw her more often than my own grandmother who died the summer before our wedding.  I also cannot relate as much to L's grief for the same reason; my family simply isn't as close as hers.  Most of my grief was regret that I knew my own grandmother so little, and failed so often to call, write, or think about her.  I never visited her, even when I was old enough to do so on my own.  Probably it never occurred to me since this is just not how my family operates, and I was already doing a good amount of travelling even to see my parents and brother, never mind anyone else.</p>
<p>The wake is Sunday, the funereal on Monday.  We'll probably go see her parents this weekend then accompany them for the rest.  </p>
<p>Perhaps I will miss my first night of class on Monday.  I am sure the prof won't care.</p>
<p>My job was immediately sympathetic and accommodating - for some reason this still surprises me a bit when people do the right thing about such life changes.</p>
