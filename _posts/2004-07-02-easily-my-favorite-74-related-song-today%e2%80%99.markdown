<p>Easily my favorite 7/4 related song - </p>
<p>Todayâ€™s the fourth of july<br />
<br />Another june has gone by<br />
<br />And when they light up our town I just think<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/aimee-mann/4741.html">What a waste of gunpowder and sky</a><br />
<br />Iâ€™m certain that I am alone<br />
<br />In harbouring thoughts of our home<br />
<br />Itâ€™s one of my faults that I canâ€™t quell my past<br />
<br />I ought to have gotten it gone</p>
<p>-Aimee Mann</p>
