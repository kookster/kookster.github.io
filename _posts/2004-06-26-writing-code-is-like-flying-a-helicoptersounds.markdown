<p>Writing code is like flying a helicopter...sounds like the start of a bad, or only slightly dirty joke.  I'll have to think of a good punchline.<br />

<p>
<br /><a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/dry3.html">Orthogonality and the DRY Principle</a>: "We've all worked on systems where you make one small change over here, and another problem pops out over there. So you go over there and fix it, but two more problems pop out somewhere else. You constantly push them back?4like that Whack-a-Mole game?4and you just never finish."</p>
