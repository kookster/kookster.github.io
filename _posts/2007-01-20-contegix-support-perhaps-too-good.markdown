  content: I take it back, they are not spoiling me, they are keeping me sane - Contegix
    Craig just fixed a bug in ActiveMessaging I have been wrestling with for 2 days.  Really,
    if you need web application hosting, I haven't seen better.

<p>I'm writing this w/o any prompting from the folks at Contegix, I 've been just really pleased with these guys this week, and wanted to put a few kind words out there.</p>
<p>So we switched to <a href="http://www.contegix.com/index.action">Contegix</a> not that long ago for <a href="http://www.prx.org">prx</a>, and I have to say, these guys are a class act.  It's not that our last hosting provider was bad - they weren't - it's just that Contegix is that much better.</p>
<p>The support just may be too good. They are spoiling me; what will I do if I have to deal with a different host?</p>
<p>I fear I may never get better at any sysadmin tasks, it is all too easy to simply write a request, and in moments you have a response, and in minutes you have it done.  I have never had better support, even when I had a dedicated team of admins around the corner.  And I'd say about half the time I ask for something, the response includes analysis and suggestions on how to do it better.</p>
<p>So this week alone, I can't say enough about the strong work from Craig, Eric, Joe and Brian - thanks again guys!<!--7aa9f01ecaadb4c19724093270f1d698--><!--533b5e904b8f73bb33c99d4b0cd46fab--><!--61de8f70ce6e4c9b9e177faccb791cc3--></p>
