<p>Just got back from a <a href="http://www.juliaontap.com/jams.html">tap jam</a> at the <a href="http://www.bccaonline.com">BCCA</a>.</p>
<p>I've gone a few times, and think I danced better at some of them, but this time was really fun, not leastwise because I ran into my friend Matt who I had neglected seeing in quite a while, and he knew many folks there around our age to whom I had not been introduced before.</p>
<p>So in other words, good tap, good time.</p>
