<p>After much thought (nano  vs. video) I finally bought my own xmas present (with the encouragement of my lovely bride).  I got the 60gig vid ipod - I am such a little consumer.</p>
<p>A few problems: my laptop does not have sufficiently powered USB port (though they are usb2 hi-speed) to charge it.  So I need to get a cradle...perhaps one like <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/72802/wo/XF3oTuu9vXoh2AFrwmv1yC1tbfG/2.SLID?mco=DFC7D8BF&amp;nplm=TE708LL%2FA">this.</a> Seriously, the cottage industry of ipod accessories must be a larger than farming in the US.</p>
<p>Also made a trip to Waaa-wa-chusett (excuse me, I have allergies), but with many other <a href="http://www.bostonphoenix.com/ski/roundup.asp">options</a> in the area, all I need is for the weather to cooperate.  Mainly, since I have friends who are much better riders than I am, the Wa was mostly a remember-what-I-am-doing kinda thing.<!--b75cc1600f93544d4157011e085d1f2e--><!--a2b2dc317212af9fb7b108ca64c9e8de--><!--711c474f93c08eacef28fe9e7934e984--></p>
