<p>first week at a new yab (that's bostonese for job you the uninitiated).</p>
<p>all strangely familar, as I got hired by a place I used to consult.</p>
<p>and 2 other guys from SAPE headed over here as well.</p>
<p>of the people I know from the last lay-off, we are the first to be placed, and the only ones I know to be placed.</p>
<p>in less weighty news, I have been drooling over the Treo device from Handspring (all gadgets in one, cool)</p>
<p>but as usual, sounds like version 1, named the 180, <a href='http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/04/05/1718252&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=100'>doesn't live up to the hope nor hype it inspired</a>.<!--ae5b1b54f3545abc9604924ef29a44f0--></p>
