  content: Yep, I've heard that EC2 is beta and closed. And i wanna use the same service
    for my own project I'm implementing now. Would you be so kind to describe what
    the actual procedure to get account on EC2 is set up now. How long do you need
    to wait. Is it a fixed period after you raise the claim to use this. Do you need
    to provide the actual description of the project and arguments to persuade the
    Amazon to open an account for you?

<p>We use Amazon S3 at PRX for images and more importantly all our audio files.  We love it.</p>
<p>What we really want to do is use EC2 - look at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=341907011">gigavox success story on amazon's site</a> - we need almost the same things, and want to implement almost the same arch - except using rails and activemessaging.</p>
<p>The problem is the EC2 closed beta - ugh - we've been waiting, oh so impatiently. In the meantime everyone shuold go get their feet wet with <a href="http://info.rightscale.com/">RightScale</a>.  You get 10 hours to play with, even without your own EC2 keys.<!--5ed9a36362296a8e1c97c7500d69316d--><!--f8e23a9e21f4d3bdff6b6bc05fa4db1d--></p>
