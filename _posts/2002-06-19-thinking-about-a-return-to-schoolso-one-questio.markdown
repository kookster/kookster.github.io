<p>Thinking about a return to school.</p>
<p>So one question is whether to suck it up and admit I am no real engineer and go the business/finance route.</p>
<p>Could be true, but I also dislike this type of work compared with the technical side of work.</p>
<p>So the other possibility is just to suck it up and go become the engineer I wish I already was.</p>
<p>That seems like a possibly frustrating path to a truer end...and a happier end as well (I hope).</p>
<p>But this is the essence of the problem, not the natural history. I've been kicking the tires on this idea for awhile, considering a multitude of angles, yet always come back to the same conclusion.  And yet I am not moving very fast to realize it, so what is the source of the lag if I know what I ought to do?  Why am I so slow to even try to get started with getting schooled again?</p>
<p>Time to bite the bullet and get started.<!--de26790dd4366b811deb4149ae457ab3--></p>
