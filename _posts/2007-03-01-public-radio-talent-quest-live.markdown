  content: "Thanks for informing about the contest. I decided to enter and invite
    all of  your readers to go and vote! It's been fun and listening to the entries
    can be addictive.\r\nMy entry \"Too Sexy for the Bus?\" by my moniker SmartWoman
    is a piece about taking mass transit in a town that just doesn't find it cool.
    Enjoy!\r\nhttp://www.publicradioquest.com/node/509"
