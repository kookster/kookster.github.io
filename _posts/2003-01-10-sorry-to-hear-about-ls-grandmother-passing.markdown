<p>Sorry to hear about L's grandmother passing. :( </p>
<p>I didn't realize you were back in school! Is this your first semester? And CS is the subject? I started and second MA program last fall, and am taking 2 classes this spring *crossing my fingers*. Just slightly less applicable than yours, it's in Critical and Creative Thinking (more on <a href="http://mattjans.blogspot.com">my blog</a> soon). Was thinking of doing a CS program but there are just too many pre-req's, since I don't have any formal comp training...hoping to slip a programming course or two in soon...</p>
<p>Later :)<!--39ee3bf951f171ee75678ca22522edea--></p>
