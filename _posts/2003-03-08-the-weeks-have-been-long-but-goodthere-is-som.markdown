<p>the weeks have been long but good.</p>
<p>there is some satisfaction to creating things, especially when you start seeing them work.  So although work has taken a huge piece of my time, attention, and energy...well, I won't say it is worth it, but it is less a waste of time when the results crystallize.</p>
<p>Here's a gem for you, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/systemisdown.html"> homestarrunner</a>.</p>
<p>On another note, had my first math exam on 3/3 since about 1995.  Don't have the results yet, but I finished it which is better than most of the class (only one other person was done before time).  There was one problem I pretty much had to learn how to solve while in the exam, but hey, that's what's good about open book/note exams - no matter how obscure the question, your real enemy is time.  </p>
<p>Anyway, another day of snowboarding today - quite likely the last this year looking at the weeks to come.<!--02f5c75c39e6f79cd680d52149f5f7e3--></p>
