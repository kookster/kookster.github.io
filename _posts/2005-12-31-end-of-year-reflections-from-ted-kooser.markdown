<p>I am a <a href="http://www.tedkooser.com/">Ted Kooser</a> fan. Why aren't you <a href="http://www.americanlifeinpoetry.org/current.html">reading his work every day</a>?</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556592019/ref=pd_bxgy_text_b/102-5799610-7616166?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Delights and Shadows</a> last month, and am ready to buy more of this retired insurance salesman/poet laureate's work. Please don't let me try and do justice to describing his work, but I will say it reminds me of <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/31">Charles Wright</a> - I heard him speak once in NYC, I think he read from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374525366/102-5799610-7616166?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Black Zodiac</a>.</p>
<p>Differently, I also enjoyed his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803227698/102-5799610-7616166?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Poetry Home Repair Manual</a>, which I am almost done reading, and only started digesting.</p>
<p>And even if you could care less, he has excellent citations/examples, so you are also getting poems that have stuck with Kooser, like this oft-mentioned one from <a href="http://ccconline.org/about/biographies/joehutchisonbio.htm">Joseph Hutchinson</a>:</p>
<p>Artichoke   <i><br />
</i>    O heart weighed down by so many wings.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Kooser, after you read that, can you ever see, or think about an artichoke the same way?</p>
<p>If all else fails to convince, I like that he writes for those of us without advanced degrees in <a href="http://www.bway.net/%7Ehunger/ulysses.html">Ulysses</a>, and most of you will like that too.</p>
<p>Today, while it has a 'rural elitist' slant (i.e. urbanites are spoiled, real life is in the country, the nobility of a rugged individual accomplishing of small things, etc.), he provides a bit on the end of the year.  It's a breath of cold air to sweep the year into the dust bin.</p>

<p>december 31<br />
Cold and snowing.</p>
<p>The opening pages forgotten,<br />
then the sadness of my mother's death<br />
in the cold, wet chapters of spring.</p>
<p>For me, featureless text of summer<br />
burning with illness, a long convalescence,<br />
then a conclusion in which<br />
the first hard frosts are lovingly described.</p>
<p>A bibliography of falling leaves,<br />
an index of bare trees,<br />
and finally, a crow flying like a signature<br />
over the soft white endpapers of the year.<!--083bc98bcf7963b0bc83f1c9ad9463c0--><!--1304ee2b7f4333b366ef886f3525eb7b--></p>
