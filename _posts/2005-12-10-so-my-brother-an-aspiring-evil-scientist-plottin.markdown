<p>So my brother, an aspiring evil scientist, plotting to take over a flat of his own, has relocated to the land of golf, sheep, and men in skirts. He too has caught the blogger-flu, and now reports from <a href="http://mightyreason.blogspot.com/">Mighty Reason</a>.</p>
<p>The real question is how much to extort from him in order to prevent me telling <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/30007">mom his new URL</a>. Of course, there is the efficacy of mutually assured destruction . Hmm. I'll have to find another means to extort the secrets of his evil plans from him.<!--a6a535e19640bb78805ad7d7434584d7--></p>
