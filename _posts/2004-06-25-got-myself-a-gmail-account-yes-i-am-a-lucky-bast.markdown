<p>Got myself a <a href="http://gmail.google.com">gmail account</a> - yes I am a lucky bastard, and yes, it is cooler than whatever email service stepped up to 1gig+ this week.</p>
<p>Gotta say it though, seems like google is keeping this beta/invite only thing alive as a marketing gimmick - surely it is stable enough to launch by now.  That said, it is all too human to feel superior because I have some ice cream, and you don't got none, na na-na na naa-na</p>
